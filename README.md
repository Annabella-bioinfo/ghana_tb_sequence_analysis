# Genomic Sequence Analysis of *M. africanum* Clinical Isolates from Ghana

## Overview
*Mycobacterium africanum* accounts for approximately 20% of TB cases in Ghana 
and up to 40-50% in some other West African countries, yet it remains less 
studied than *M. tuberculosis*. Understanding the genetic diversity of local 
clinical isolates matters for drug resistance surveillance; particularly in 
the rpoB gene, where mutations drive resistance to rifampicin, a first-line 
TB drug.

This project uses Python and Biopython to analyze rpoB and hsp65 gene sequences 
from *M. africanum* isolates collected from Ghanaian TB patients. The sequences 
were first characterized using NCBI BLAST, then explored programmatically to 
calculate GC content, check data quality, and quantify inter-strain genetic 
differences.

## Data Source
- 4 partial gene sequences from NCBI GenBank (accessions FJ617583-FJ617586)
- Organism: *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* variant africanum
- Source: Human sputum samples, Ghana
- Reference: Goncalves Vasconcellos et al., distinct genotypic profiles of 
  *M. africanum* clades causing tuberculosis in Ghana

## Tools Used
- Python 3.13
- Biopython (SeqIO, SeqUtils)
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- NCBI BLAST (sequence characterization)

## Analysis
The notebook covers:
1. Loading and verifying FASTA sequences
2. GC content calculation and visualization
3. Sequence quality check (ambiguous base count)
4. Pairwise SNP comparison between Ghanaian strains
5. Heatmap visualization of inter-strain differences

## Key Findings
- All sequences have GC content between 62-64%, consistent with the known 
  high-GC signature of the *M. tuberculosis* complex
- No ambiguous bases found; all four sequences are clean and suitable 
  for analysis
- Two SNP positions identified at positions 166 and 280 across the three 
  rpoB strains
- FJ617585 and FJ617584 are the most divergent pair (2 SNPs apart), while 
  FJ617586 sits between them with 1 SNP difference from each
- This pattern suggests at least two distinct rpoB lineages of *M. africanum* 
  are circulating in Ghana — one matching the global majority sequence and 
  one carrying local variants. If either SNP falls within the rifampicin 
  resistance-determining region (RRDR), it could have direct implications 
  for TB treatment outcomes in Ghana
